## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Things to ask
- Why is there a line under the letters when you type in the text field, like if the text was underline.
- How can I put different fontweights, fontstyles within the same text.
- How to make all the Mediums Italics in initScreen.dart left aligned and the Regular texts center aligned.
- Ask what is the image between Image.asset and Image(image:)
- Ask how to move the icons in the bottom so they have more space between them
- Why the Sign up button it's a little more to the right than the New Around here button?

## TODO's
- Remove the greytextField in case I dont use it in the future.
